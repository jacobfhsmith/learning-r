# Functions

## Learning objectives

- Function calls and syntax
- Writing functions
- Best practices

## Introduction

The ability to write and understand functions will elevate your skill set as a
data scientist, statistician, and R programmer. By writing and using functions
you can tackle one big problem by breaking it up into smaller key steps, where
a set of functions you created is used to complete the
necessary tasks. Incorporating functions into your workflow will

- make your work more reproducible,
- make your code more readable,
- improve your coding style, and
- decrease the number of bugs in your code.

to Duke's wireless network via VPN if off-campus.
