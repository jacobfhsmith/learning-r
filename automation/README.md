# Automation

## Learning objectives

- When to use iteration
- Understand the `for` loop structure
- When to not use a loop

## Introduction

Writing and using functions is one way to reduce duplication in your code.
However, functions alone will not be able to eliminate all instances of
duplication. You may be able to write a function to scale each numeric variable
in a data frame to a [0, 1] scale. But, if you need to apply this function
to 30 variables in that data frame there will be duplication. This is where
iteration (automation) plays a role in reducing duplication. R offers loops
and functionals as tools for reducing duplication through iteration. This
tutorial will introduce you to automation through `for` loops.

to Duke's wireless network via VPN if off-campus.
