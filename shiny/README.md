## Introduction

Shiny is an R package that makes it easy to build interactive web apps straight
from R. You can host standalone apps on a webpage or embed them in R Markdown
documents or build dashboards. You can also extend your Shiny apps with CSS
themes, htmlwidgets, and JavaScript actions. To get an idea of Shiny's
capabilities check our the Shiny gallery at https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/.

to Duke's wireless network via VPN if off-campus.
